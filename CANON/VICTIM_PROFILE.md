# Victim Profile

## Basic Information

**Full Name:** Kyle "K-Dawg" Andersson
**Nickname/Handle:** @KDawgEats
**Age:** 27
**Nationality:** Swedish-American (raised in Minnesota)
**Occupation:** Full-time "Food Content Creator" (mukbang/competitive eating)

## Archetype
**Primary:** Influencer / Content Creator

**Secondary traits:**
- Former normal person completely absorbed by content creation
- Measures all experiences by engagement potential
- Secretly terrified that he's wasting his life

## The Fatal Flaw
**Core Flaw:** Vanity

**How it manifests:**
- Cannot experience anything without filming it
- Prioritizes content over common sense and safety
- Confuses followers with friends, views with validation

**How it kills them:**
Kyle's need to constantly one-up himself and generate engagement leads him to attempt an eating challenge that his body simply cannot handle, ignoring every physical warning because stopping would mean losing face in front of his audience.

## Physical Appearance
- **Height/Build:** 6'0", once athletic but now carrying mukbang weight, face is puffy from sodium
- **Hair:** Dirty blonde, styled in that "messy-but-takes-45-minutes" way
- **Distinguishing features:** Permanent ring-light tan, bleached teeth, slightly too-tight clothes to show he "used to be fit"
- **Typical outfit:** Branded merch with his own logo, backwards cap, always wears AirPods

## Personality

### Positive Traits (that get twisted)
1. Dedication and work ethic - becomes obsessive content creation at any cost
2. Natural charisma - becomes performed authenticity that's hollow underneath

### Negative Traits (that seal their fate)
1. Need for external validation - leads to constantly escalating stunts
2. Inability to say no to a challenge - leads to fatal competitive decision

### Pet Peeves
- People eating "wrong" for camera
- Bad lighting
- Anyone with more followers than him
- Being called "just a YouTuber"

### Fears
- Surface fear: Becoming irrelevant, algorithm changes, being "canceled"
- Deeper fear: That his entire identity has become performance and there's nothing real underneath

## Background

### Origin Story
Normal Minnesota kid, played hockey, went to state college. Started making food videos during COVID lockdown as a joke. One went viral. Then another. Dropped out of school when his channel hit 100K. Now at 1.2M subscribers and doesn't know how to do anything else. His parents don't understand what he does but they're proud of him. He thinks.

### Why They Travel
"International food content" gets more views than domestic. He's also running from the creeping realization that he hasn't had a conversation in two years that wasn't about content. Travel feels like doing something real, even when he's filming every second.

### How They Ended Up at This Hostel
Planning a "Japan Food Challenge" series. Heard about a famous hostel in Osaka that does weekly food competitions. Perfect content opportunity. Booked immediately, already pre-announced the video to his audience.

## Voice & Speech

### Vocabulary
- Uses words like: "Content," "engagement," "viral," "let's gooo," "smash that like button," "what's up guys"
- Avoids words like: Emotional depth, nuance, anything that can't be a caption
- Catchphrases: "No cap this is insane" / "This is gonna hit different" / "You guys are gonna freak out"

### Speech Pattern
- Speaks in clickbait sentences
- Volume always slightly too loud
- Uses YouTube cadence even in normal conversation
- Everything is "the best ever" or "insane"

### Internal Monologue Style
Constant calculation of engagement potential. Every thought filters through "how would this perform?" Underlying anxiety about metrics, about relevance, about being nobody without the camera. The algorithm lives in his head rent-free.

## Digital Presence

### Social Media
- **Platform of choice:** YouTube main, TikTok for clips, Instagram for lifestyle
- **Follower count:** 1.2M YouTube, 800K TikTok, 400K Instagram
- **Posting style:** High-energy, jump cuts, challenge videos, EXTREME FOOD content
- **Last post before death:** "LIVE NOW: ATTEMPTING JAPAN'S DEADLIEST NOODLE CHALLENGE" - posted 12 minutes before death

### Online vs Reality
Online Kyle is confident, successful, living the dream. Reality: He's lonely, hasn't had a close friend in years, and cries in hostel bathrooms when his videos underperform. His "authentic" brand is as constructed as any corporate image.

## Relationships

### Family
- Parents (Erik and Susan): Supportive but confused. Haven't seen him in person in 18 months.
- Sister (Emma): Worried about him, unfollowed his channels because watching him "hurts"

### Friends
- "Friends" are all collaborators with their own engagement incentives
- No one from before YouTube
- Genuinely lonely but never admits it

### Romantic
- Dating another content creator (long-distance, mostly for cross-promotion)
- Neither would call it love

### At the Hostel
- Immediately scans for potential collaborators/competitors
- Recruits hostel guests as "background extras" for content
- Annoys quiet guests with constant filming
- Finds his eventual opponent, Takeshi, another competitive eater

## The Day They Die

### Morning
Wakes up, checks analytics before getting out of bed. Yesterday's video did 8% below projected. Panic. Needs today's content to be HUGE. Skips breakfast "for the content" - wants to be "hungry" for the challenge.

### Their Last Normal Moment
An hour before the challenge, sitting by the hostel window, looking at Osaka without his phone for maybe the first time. For three minutes, he just watches people walk by. Almost feels peaceful. Then the notification chimes and the moment is gone.

### Final Thoughts
*This isn't happening. I can't breathe. Someone help. Why isn't anyone helping? They're all just filming. No no no this can't be it. I was supposed to be somebody. I was supposed to... the camera... is the camera still recording? Mom, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I can't...*

### Last Words
Can't speak - choking. Last sound is a wet, desperate gasp. His eyes plead at the camera still recording.

## Writing This Character

### POV Notes
When in this character's head:
- They notice: Lighting, camera angles, who might be filming, engagement opportunities
- They ignore: His own body's signals, genuine human connection attempts, anything that can't be content
- They judge: Everyone by their follower count and content potential

### Key Scenes Checklist
- [ ] Introduction scene establishing archetype (arrives filming, immediately asks about wifi quality)
- [ ] Fatal flaw demonstration (early) - misses a genuine moment because he was checking analytics
- [ ] Sympathetic moment (make reader care) - late-night phone call with sister where he almost opens up
- [ ] Warning ignored scene - local warns him about the challenge, he laughs it off
- [ ] Point of no return - the challenge begins, the noodles start coming
- [ ] The death
